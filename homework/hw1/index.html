<h3 id="20-work-with-core-pandas-and-scikit-learn-concepts-in-data-data-types-representation-of-data-and-plotting-data">(20%) Work with core Pandas and Scikit-Learn concepts in data, data types, representation of data and plotting data</h3>

<p>A great deal of time doing data mining involves understanding the data in a dataset and preprocessing it in preparation for working with it in a real analysis of some sort.  We will develop an understanding of:</p>

<ul>
<li>how to empirically perform and understand the descriptive statistics of a dataset,</li>
<li>understand how to reason about data features,</li>
<li>understand how to use distance metrics,</li>
<li>understand binarizaration contexts abd techniques, and</li>
<li>understand how to randomly sample datasets to understand the distribution of data.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be working a new  much smaller dataset for this task.  Please check the repository for the <a href="https://github.com/kmsaumcis/mcis6273_f17_datamining/blob/master/homework/hw1/bank-data.csv"><code>bank.csv</code> data set</a>.  There are fewer than 1000 rows to work with in this data.  You will need to use <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">Scikit-Learn</a> for all the questions here, and it is recommended you take a look at the optional cheat sheets <a href="https://kmsaumcis.gitbub.io/mcis6273_f17_datamining/syllabus">for lecture 2 in the syllabus</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook">Pandas Cookbook Github Repo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/PandasPythonForDataScience.pdf">Pandas Cheatsheet @ DataCamp.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>&#167;  In the readings and lecture, we talked about distributions of data.  Please produce the frequency distribution (histogram) for the following:  (1) rural income, (2) car ownership.  You will most certainly need to use the <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html#visualization-hist"><code>pandas.Series.plot.hist()</code></a> method.</p>

<p>&#167;  Produce the scatter plot for income vs age &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t matter which
is on the $x$ and $y$ axis.  You will benefit from the <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.scatter.html#pandas.DataFrame.plot.scatter"><code>DataFrame.plot.scatter()</code></a> method.</p>

<h3 id="40-explore-concepts-in-statistical-inference-over-real-data-within-scikit-learn">(40%) Explore concepts in statistical inference over real data within Scikit-Learn</h3>

<p><strong>For questions 1-3</strong>: Just answer the question over the entire data
as requested.</p>

<p><strong>For questions 4 and 5</strong>: Consider this scenario &hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bank is looking for candidates who might be good for sending
mortgage loan information to &ndash; that is they are looking for people
who are <strong>not homeowners</strong> (i.e. don&rsquo;t own a home), but who have
the income and other characteristics of potentially good
borrowers.</p>

<p>Your task is to look at all the data for people who have no mortgage
and build the case for the profile of the borrower (from this dataset)
that they should start calling, sending mail and advertising to.</p>

<p>Imagine you are a real-world analyst and will need to do the following:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>build the dataset that contains non-homeowners (i.e. no mortgage)</li>
<li>report on the characteristics of non-homeowners based on what is being asked</li>
</ul>

<p>&#167;  What is the median age of a <code>UNMARRIED</code>, <code>FEMALE</code>, <code>HOME OWNER</code> in the <code>SUBURBAN</code> region?</p>

<p>&#167;  Given this bank datset what is the joint probability $\Pr( \mathrm{sex} = MALE \wedge \mathrm{income} \ge 50,000 )$?  How does this compare with $\Pr( \mathrm{sex} = FEMALE \wedge \mathrm{income} \ge 50,000 )$?</p>

<p>&#167;  What is  conditional probability $\Pr( car = \mathrm{TRUE} \big| sex = \mathrm{MALE} \wedge income \ge \mathrm{50,000} )$?</p>

<p>&#167;  If the lending requirements were a savings account and income greater
than $45,000, what about this data might make it difficult to justify
any campaign at all?  (<strong>HINT:</strong> most mortgages are 30-years in duration) Provide <strong>concrete evidence</strong> for your claims; you may do this in a variety of ways <em>including describing the statistic that leads you to your claim</em>.</p>

<p>&#167;  If the savings account requirement was ignored and the income
lowered to a minimum of $30,000, to whom (<code>MALE</code> or <code>FEMALE</code>) and in
which region (<code>RURAL</code>, <code>TOWN</code>, <code>INNER_CITY</code>, <code>SUBURBAN</code>) would
the bank likely have the best success?</p>

<h3 id="40-work-with-data-to-understand-distance-metrics-in-scikit-learn-and-the-impact-various-metrics-have-on-the-outcomes">(40%) Work with data to understand distance metrics in Scikit-Learn and the impact various metrics have on the outcomes</h3>

<p>A common thing to understand in a dataset is to determine some
number of <em>nearest neighbors</em> to a data point.  We will see this come
back when we get to clustering.  For now, let&rsquo;s explore the
<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.html#sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors">NearestNeighbor</a>
implementation in Scikit-Learn.</p>

<p>You will most certainly need to convert the categorical non-numeric data
to binary features, and you may be served well by reading about
<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing">preprocessing data in Scikit-Learn</a> and also taking
a closer look at <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelBinarizer.html#sklearn.preprocessing.LabelBinarizer"><code>sklearn.preprocessing.LabelBinarizer</code></a> and <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html#sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder"><code>sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder</code></a>.  You might also find
<a href="https://courses.edx.org/c4x/BerkeleyX/CS190.1x/asset/CS190.1x_week4b.pdf">this resource</a>
of value if you read only the first few slides on binarization.</p>

<p>&#167;  What are the 5 nearest neighbors (the indices) to index #7, #21, #40
and #94?  Your output will be a list of the tuples
of the 5 closest indices and their values (e.g. <code>[(5, 4.56356), (19, 8.83452), (233, 12.23486), ...]</code>).  Use the <em>minkowski
(default) distance</em> first.</p>

<p>&#167;  Use the <em>cosine similarity metric</em> and <em>euclidean distance metric</em>
(e.g. invoke <code>NearestNeighbor(..., metric='cosine')</code> and <code>NearestNeighbor(..., metric='euclidean')</code>).
Produce the same lists for the same indices as in #1.  What are
the differences in the nearest neighbor lists?  Which seem to be
the most similar? Provide your thoughts on why there are differences?</p>
